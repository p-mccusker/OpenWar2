Symbols used:

char    occupy 1 byte.
byte    occupy 1 byte.
word    occupy 2 bytes.

The pud format consist of many sections, all sections start the same way:

        4 char          name of section
        long            length of the data (excluding header info)
        ...             data

0: Section 'TYPE', identifies as a PUD file

       10 bytes     'WAR2 MAP' + 00 00
        2 bytes     unused (always set to $0a and $ff by edtior,
                            but can be anything for the game)
        4 bytes     id tag (for consistence check in multiplayer)

1: Section 'VER ', identifies PUD version

        word        version
        0x11 = Maps without new heroes. (see Note1)

        0x13 = Maps with new heroes. (see Note2)

        Note1: v1.3 supports new heroes, but the editor does not.

        Note2: v1.00 - 1.3 will not accept a map vith this set.
               It will not show up in selectlist of maps in the game.

2: Section 'DESC', PUD description

        32 bytes        null terminated description

3: Section 'OWNR', identifies controller of each side

        8 bytes         8 player slots (0-7)
        7 bytes         "unusable" 7 player slots (8-14)
        byte            neutral (15)

        should be:

        0x02             passive computer
        0x03             nobody
        0x04             computer
        0x05             human

        0x01             computer
        0x08 - 0xff      passive computer

See appendix E for possible use of "unusable" 7 players.

4: Section 'ERA ', terrain type.

        word            terrain

        should be:

        $00             forest
        $01             winter
        $02             wasteland
        $03             swamp (see Note1 and Note2)

        Note1: The mapeditor, v1.0 - 1.3 will make a runtime error.
               v1.33 will display this as forest.

        Note2: The game, v1.0 - 1.2p will display this as forest.
               v1.3 - 1.33 will display this as swamp

        can also be:

        $04 - $ff       forest

4.1: Section 'ERAX', terrain type. (Optional)

       *If v1.33 ERAX will be used instead of ERA, if it is present.
       *If v1.0 - 1.3 ERAX is ignored, ERA will be used.
       *This has nothing to do with what VER it is.

        word            terrain

        should be:

        $00             forest
        $01             winter
        $02             wasteland
        $03             swamp

        can also be:

        $04 - $ff       forest

5: Section 'DIM ', map dimensions

        word            x
        word            y

        Standard i 32x32, 64x64, 96x96 and 128x128.
        The minimap in the game will automatic fit it self to the size.

        The map can be any size you want, but max. 128x128.
        Just be sure that MTXM,SQN,OILM and REGN correspond to that size, or
        contains enough data to make a map, else you get an error. The
        x and y size has to be the same size, in fact no the don't, because
        the game will always make a map out of the y size. (looks like
        the x size is just fill ?)
        If the y size is off standard, the minimap in the game will
        default to 128x128, but the units movement on the map will correspond
        to the size, and so the white square, the fog of war thing will
        move as to a 128x128 map.
        The editor will make an error if you try to read an off standard map
        size.

Appendix E: "Unusable" 7 players.

This 7 players is not really in the game, so the can't be used as normal
players. However there are some use for them.
They don't work as passive computer, human or computer, if set to this
they just stand there, looking funny.

If set to rescue(active), you can rescue them, and the become you
units, whom you can control as normally.

If rescue(active) has a peon/peasant, he will only build a town hall
and x number of farm, depending of the number of peon/peasant he has, then
stop and do nothing.

If set to rescue(passive), you can rescue his units, and then control
them.

So if you are in need of more rescue players on your map, you can used
the  "unusable" 7 players.

Note : player 14 unit will never be displayed ?, but he's units IS on
the map, because you can't build were he's units would have been !.
